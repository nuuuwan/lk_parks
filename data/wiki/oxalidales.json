Compound leaves are common in Oxalidales and the majority of the species in this order have five or six sepals and petals. The following families are typically placed here:\nFamily Brunelliaceae\nFamily Cephalotaceae (Cephalotus follicularis)\nFamily Connaraceae\nFamily Cunoniaceae\nFamily Elaeocarpaceae\nFamily Huaceae\nFamily Oxalidaceae (wood sorrel family)The family Cephalotaceae contains a single species, a pitcher plant found in Southwest Australia.\nUnder the Cronquist system, most of the above families were placed in the Rosales. The Oxalidaceae were placed in the Geraniales, and the Elaeocarpaceae split between the Malvales and Polygalales, in the latter case being treated as the Tremandraceae."
