  "summary": "The Fagales are an order of flowering plants, including some of the best-known trees.  The order name is derived from genus Fagus, beeches.  They belong among the rosid group of dicotyledons. The families and genera currently included are as follows:\n\nBetulaceae \u2013 birch family (Alnus, Betula, Carpinus, Corylus, Ostrya, and Ostryopsis)\nCasuarinaceae \u2013 she-oak family (Allocasuarina, Casuarina, Ceuthostoma, and Gymnostoma)\nFagaceae \u2013 beech family (Castanea, Castanopsis, Chrysolepis, Fagus, Lithocarpus, Notholithocarpus, Quercus, and Trigonobalanus)\nJuglandaceae \u2013 walnut family (Alfaroa, Carya, Cyclocarya, Engelhardia, Juglans, Oreomunnea,  Platycarya, Pterocarya, and Rhoiptelea)\nMyricaceae \u2013 bayberry family (Canacomyrica, Comptonia, and Myrica)\nNothofagaceae \u2013 southern beech family (Nothofagus)\nTicodendraceae \u2013 ticodendron family (Ticodendron)The older Cronquist system only included four families (Betulaceae, Corylaceae, Fagaceae, Ticodendraceae; Corylaceae now being included within Betulaceae); this arrangement is followed by, for example, the World Checklist of selected plant families. The other families were split into three different orders, placed among the Hamamelidae.  The Casuarinales comprised the single family Casuarinaceae, the Juglandales comprised the Juglandaceae and Rhoipteleaceae, and the Myricales comprised the remaining forms (plus Balanops).  The change is due to studies suggesting the Myricales, so defined, are paraphyletic to the other two groups."
