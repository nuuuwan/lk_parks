  "summary": "Chamaedorea is a genus of 107 species of palms, native to subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas. They are small palms, growing to 0.3\u20136 m (1 ft 0 in \u2013 19 ft 8 in) tall with slender, cane-like stems, growing in the understory in rainforests, and often spreading by means of underground runners, forming clonal colonies. The leaves are pinnate (rarely entire), with one to numerous leaflets. The flowers are produced in inflorescences; they are dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants. The fruit is an orange or red drupe 0.5\u20132 cm diameter. Perhaps the best-known species is Chamaedorea elegans (neanthe bella palm or parlor palm) from Mexico and Guatemala. It is popular as a houseplant, particularly in Victorian houses. Another well-known species is Chamaedorea seifrizii, the bamboo palm or reed palm.\nThe name Chamaedorea comes from Ancient Greek  \u03c7\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03af (chamai) 'on the ground', and  \u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03b5\u03ac (dorea) 'gift', in reference to easily  reached fruits, or the plants' low-growing nature."
