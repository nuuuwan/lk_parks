  "summary": "Ziziphus mauritiana, also known as Indian jujube, Indian plum, Chinese date, Chinese apple, ber  and dunks is a tropical fruit tree species belonging to the family Rhamnaceae.  It is often confused with the closely related Chinese jujube (Z. jujuba), but whereas Z. jujuba prefers temperate climates, Z. mauritiana is tropical to subtropical.Ziziphus mauritiana is a spiny, evergreen shrub or small tree up to 15 m high, with trunk 40 cm or more in diameter; spreading crown; stipular spines and many drooping branches. The fruit is of variable shape and size. It can be oval, obovate, oblong or round, and can be 1-2.5 in (2.5-6.25 cm) long, depending on the variety. The flesh is white and crisp. When slightly underipe, this fruit is a bit juicy and has a pleasant aroma. The fruit's skin is smooth, glossy, thin but tight.\nThe species is believed to have originated in Indo-Malaysian region of South and South-East Asia. It is now widely naturalised throughout the Old World tropics from Southern Africa through the Middle East to the Indian subcontinent and China, Indomalaya, and into Australasia and the Pacific Islands. While the Rhamnaceae family are considered nitrogen fixing trees, Ziziphus mauritiana can form dense stands and become invasive in some areas, including Fiji and Australia, and has become a serious environmental weed in Northern Australia. It is a fast-growing tree with a medium lifespan, that can quickly reach up to 10\u201340 ft (3 to 12 m) tall."
