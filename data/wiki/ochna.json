  "summary": "Ochna is a genus comprising 79 species of evergreen trees, shrubs and shrublets belonging to the flowering plant family Ochnaceae. These species are native to tropical woodlands of Africa, Madagascar, the Mascarenes and Asia. Species of this genus are usually called ochnas, bird's-eye bushes or Mickey-mouse plants, a name derived from the shape of the drupelet fruit. The name of this genus comes from the Greek word \u1f44\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 (\u00f3khn\u0113), used by Theocritus and meaning \"wild pear\", as the leaves are similar in appearance. Some species, including Ochna integerrima (yellow Mai flower) and O. serrulata (bird's eye plant), are cultivated as decorative plants."
