  "summary": "Inga edulis, known as ice-cream bean, ice-cream-bean, joaquiniquil, cuaniquil (both from Nahuatl: cuahuxinicuile combining cuahuitl \"tree\"; icxitl \"feet\" and necuilli \"crooked\") guama or guaba, is a fruit native to South America. It is in the mimosoid tribe of the legume family Fabaceae. It is widely grown, especially by Indigenous Amazonians, for shade, food, timber, medicine, and production of the alcoholic beverage cachiri. It is popular in Peru, Ecuador, Pernambuco-Brazil, Venezuela, Guyana and Colombia. The taxonomic name Inga is derived from its name with the Tup\u00ed people of South America (ing\u00e1) while the species name edulis is Latin for \"edible\". The common name \"ice-cream bean\" alludes to the sweet flavor and smooth texture of the pulp."
