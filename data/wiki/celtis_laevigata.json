  "summary": "Celtis laevigata is a medium-sized tree native to North America.  Common names include sugarberry, southern hackberry, or in the southern U.S. sugar hackberry or just hackberry.\nSugarberry is easily confused with common hackberry (C. occidentalis) where the range overlaps.  Sugarberry has narrower leaves with mostly smooth margins, the berries are juicier and sweeter, while the bark is less corky. The species can also be distinguished by habitat: where the ranges overlap, common hackberry occurs primarily in upland areas, whereas sugarberry occurs mainly in bottomland areas.Sugarberry's range extends from the Eastern United States west to Texas and south to northeastern Mexico. It is also found on the island of Bermuda."
