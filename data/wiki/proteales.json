  "summary": "Proteales is an order of flowering plants consisting of three (or four) families. The Proteales have been recognized by almost all taxonomists.\nThe representatives of the Proteales are very different from each other due to their very early divergence. What they have in common is seeds with little or no endosperm. The ovules are often atropic.\nThe oldest fossils of Proteales are of the nelumbonaceous genus Notocyamus from the Barremian stage of the Early Cretaceous of Brazil."
