## About

This project aims to use Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence to identify plants in Sri Lanka's public parks, beginning with Viharamahadevi Park, Colombo.

Plant Identifications are from  [PlantNet](https://plantnet.org), a citizen science project for automatic plant identification through photographs and based on machine learning.

*We only consider results where the model's identification confidence is **‚â• 20%.***

## Viharamahadevi Park

Viharamahadevi Park (Sinhala: ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∑Ñ‡∑è‡∂ª‡∂∏‡∑Ñ‡∑è‡∂Ø‡∑ö‡∑Ä‡∑ì ‡∂ã‡∂Ø‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂∫‡∑è‡∂±‡∂∫; formerly Victoria Park, Sinhala: ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂ö‡∑ä‡∂ß‡∑ù‡∂ª‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑è ‡∂¥‡∑è‡∂ö‡∑ä) is a public park located in Cinnamon Gardens, in [Colombo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo), situated in front of the colonial-era Town Hall in Sri Lanka. It was built by the British colonial administration and is the oldest and largest park of Colombo. The park was originally named "Victoria Park" after Queen Victoria but was renamed after Queen Viharamahadevi, the mother of King Dutugamunu on July 18, 1958. [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viharamahadevi_Park)]

Viharamahadevi Park is 24.27ha, and has an estimated [green cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation) of 14.39ha (59% from the total area). The estimated crown cover 12.25ha (50%).

## Plant Photo Funnel

Of all the photos taken (**All**),
 we filter photos that are
 within the desired geographical area (**In Geo**)

Next, we filter photos that are likely not 
duplicates (**Deduped**).

Finally, we only consider identifications
 where the model confidence is at least 
20% (**‚â• 20%**). 
We list statistics for 5%, 10% and 50% as well.
