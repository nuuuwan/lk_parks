  "summary": "Terminalia bellirica, known as baheda, bahera, behada, beleric or bastard myrobalan (Arabic: beliledj \u0628\u0644\u064a\u0644\u062c, borrowed from Middle Persian Balilag), Persian \u0628\u0644\u06cc\u0644\u0647 (Balileh), Sanskrit: Vibh\u012btaka \u092c\u093f\u092d\u0940\u0924\u0915, Aksha \u0905\u0915\u094d\u0937) is a large deciduous tree in the Combretaceae family. It is common on the plains and lower hills in South and Southeast Asia, where it is also grown as an avenue tree. The basionym is Myrobalanus bellirica Gaertn. (Fruct. Sem. Pl. 2: 90, t. 97. 1791). William Roxburgh transferred M. bellirica to Terminalia as \"T. bellerica (Gaertn.) Roxb.\". This spelling error is now widely used, causing confusion. The correct name is Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb."
