DNA analysis has shown that a third species, Rosa fedtschenkoana, has made some genetic contributions to the Damask rose.The flowers are renowned for their fine fragrance, and are commercially harvested for rose oil (either \"rose otto\" or \"rose absolute\") used in perfumery and to make rose water and \"rose concrete\". The flower petals are also edible.  They may be used to flavor food, as a garnish, as an herbal tea, and preserved in sugar as gulkand.\nIt is the national flower of Iran."
