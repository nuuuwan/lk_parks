  "summary": "Sapindus  is a genus of about thirteen species of shrubs and small trees in the lychee family, Sapindaceae and tribe Sapindeae.  It is native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the world. The genus includes both deciduous and evergreen species. Members of the genus are commonly known as soapberries or soapnuts because the fruit pulp is used to make soap. The generic name is derived from the Latin words sapo, meaning \"soap\", and indicus, meaning \"of India\".The leaves are alternate, 15\u201340 cm (5.9\u201315.7 in) long, pinnate (except in S. oahuensis, which has simple leaves), with 14-30 leaflets, the terminal leaflet often absent. The flowers form in large panicles, each flower small, creamy white. The fruit is a small leathery-skinned drupe 1\u20132 cm (0.39\u20130.79 in) in diameter, yellow ripening blackish, containing one to three seeds."
