  "summary": "Phytolaccaceae is a family of flowering plants. Though almost universally recognized by taxonomists, its circumscription has varied. It is also known as the Pokeweed family.\nThe APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), also recognizes this family and assigns it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots. The family comprises five genera, totalling 33 known species. It is divided into the subfamilies Agdestioideae and Phytolaccoideae, with the former Rivinioideae in the Takhtajan system, now placed in its own family Petiveriaceae"
