  "summary": "Thunbergia alata, commonly called black-eyed Susan vine, is a herbaceous perennial climbing plant species in the family Acanthaceae.  It is native to Eastern Africa, and has been naturalized in other parts of the world.\nIt is grown as an ornamental plant in gardens and in hanging baskets.  The name 'Black-eyed Susan' is thought to have come from a character that figures in many traditional ballads and songs.  In the Ballad of Black-eyed Susan by John Gay, Susan goes aboard a ship in-dock to ask the sailors where her lover Sweet William has gone.  Black-eyed Susan is also a name given to other species of flowers in the genus Rudbeckia."
