An example natural occurrence is in coastal Yucat\u00e1n, in the Petenes mangroves ecoregion, where it is a subdominant plant species. It was introduced to the Philippines during Spanish colonization. It is grown in large quantities in Mexico and in tropical Asia, including India, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, as well as in the Caribbean.\nThe specific epithet zapota is from the Spanish zapote [sa\u02c8pote], which ultimately derives from the Nahuatl word tzapotl."
