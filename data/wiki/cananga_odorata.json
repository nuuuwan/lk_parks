It is also native to parts of Thailand and Vietnam. It is valued for the essential oils extracted from its flowers (also called \"ylang-ylang\"), which has a strong floral fragrance. Ylang-ylang is one of the most extensively used natural materials in the perfume industry, earning it the name \"Queen of Perfumes\".The climbing ylang-ylang vine, Artabotrys hexapetalus (synonym A. odoratissimus) is a woody, evergreen climbing plant in the same family, which is also a source of perfume."
