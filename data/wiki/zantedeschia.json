  "summary": "Zantedeschia  is a genus of eight species of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants in the aroid family, Araceae, native to southern Africa (from South Africa northeast to Malawi). The genus has been introduced, in some form, on every continent (minus Antarctica). \nCommon names include arum lily for Z. aethiopica, calla and calla lily for Z. elliottiana and Z. rehmannii. However, members of this genus are not true lilies (which belong to the family Liliaceae), and the genera Arum and Calla, although related, are distinct from Zantedeschia, despite visual similarities. The colourful flowers and leaves, of both species and cultivars, are greatly valued and commonly grown as ornamental and garden plants."
