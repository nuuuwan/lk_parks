The Spanish name roble de sabana, meaning \"savannah oak\", is widely used in Costa Rica, probably because it often remains in heavily deforested areas and because of the resemblance of its wood to that of oak trees. It is the national tree of El Salvador, where it is called \"Maquil\u00edshuat\"."
