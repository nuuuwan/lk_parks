  "summary": "The Clusiaceae or Guttiferae Juss. (1789) (nom. alt. et cons. = alternative and valid name) are a family of plants including 13 genera and ca 750 species. Several former members of Clusiacae are now  placed in Calophyllaceae and Hypericaceae. They are mostly trees and shrubs, with milky sap and fruits or capsules for seeds. The family is primarily tropical. More so than many plant families, it shows large variation in plant morphology (for example, three to 10, fused or unfused petals, and many other traits). According to the APG III, this family belongs to the order Malpighiales.\nOne feature which is sometimes found in this family, and rarely in others (e.g., Malpighiaceae), is providing pollinators with \"pollination rewards\" other than pollen or nectar; specifically, some species offer resin, which certain bees use in nest construction (each Clusiaceae species offers only one type of reward)."
