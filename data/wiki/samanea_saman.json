  "summary": "Samanea saman is a species of flowering tree in the pea family, Fabaceae, now in the Mimosoid clade and is native to Central and South America. It is often placed in the genus Samanea, which by yet other authors is subsumed in Albizia entirely.\nIts range extends from Mexico south to Peru and Brazil, but it has been widely introduced to South and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii. It is a well-known tree, rivaled perhaps only by lebbeck and pink siris among its genus. It is well represented in many languages and has numerous local names in its native range; common English names include saman, rain tree and monkeypod (see also \u00a7 Names below).\nIn Cambodia it is colloquially known as the Chankiri Tree (can be written \u1785\u1793\u17d2\u1791\u1782\u17b7\u179a\u17b8 or \u1785\u1793\u17d2\u1791\u17cd\u1782\u17b8\u179a\u17b8)."
