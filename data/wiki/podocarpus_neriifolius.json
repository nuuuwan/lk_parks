  "summary": "Podocarpus neriifolius is a species of conifer in the family Podocarpaceae. It grows 10\u201315m tall, though very occasionally taller, in tropical and subtropical wet closed forests, between 650m and 1600m elevation. In Cambodia however it grows in a dwarf form some 2\u20134m tall, at Bokor, some 1000m elevation.\nIt ranges from Nepal, eastern India,and Bangladesh through parts of Indochina (Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam) and Malesia (Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi, and the Philippines).Previously the species was thought to range eastwards as far as Fiji. David J. de Laubenfels identified the eastern populations from New Guinea to Fiji as a separate species, Podocarpus idenburgensis, distinguished by narrow, acute leaves.Its common name in Khmer is sr\u00f4:l.It has a yellowish wood, used in construction in Cambodia, where it is graded 2nd category (not as good as 1st, but above others).\n\n\n== References =="
