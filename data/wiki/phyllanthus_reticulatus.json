In Vietnamese its name is ph\u00e8n \u0111en (sometimes di\u1ec7p h\u1ea1 ch\u00e2u m\u1ea1ng). It is also found in Northern Australia,  where the aborigines of the Moyle River area use the wood for firesticks and call it Mirrinymirriny.It is also found in abundance in the Terai areas of Uttar Pradesh (India) along the banks of ponds, which is called Sikati / Sikti \u0938\u093f\u0915\u091f\u0940/\u0938\u093f\u0915\u094d\u091f\u0940 in the local language.\nPhyllanthus reticulatus is pollinated by several different species of Epicephala in East Asia. The adult moths pollinate the flowers but lay eggs in the P. reticulatus flowers' ovaries, where the emerging larvae consume some of the developing seeds."
