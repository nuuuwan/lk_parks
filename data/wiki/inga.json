  "summary": "Inga is a genus of small tropical, tough-leaved, nitrogen-fixing trees and shrubs, subfamily Mimosoideae. Inga's leaves are pinnate, and flowers are generally white. Many of the hundreds of species are used ornamentally.\nSeveral related plants have been placed into this genus at one time, for example Yopo (Cohoba, Mopo, Nopo or Parica \u2013 Anadenanthera peregrina \u2013 as Inga niopo).The seeds are covered with sweet white powder. The pulp covering the seeds is lightly fibrous and sweet, and rich in minerals; it is edible in the raw state. The tree's name originates from the Tupi word in-g\u00e1 meaning \"soaked\", due to the fruit powder consistency. The tree usually blooms twice a year.\nWithin the Inga genus there are around 300 species, most of them native and growing in the Amazon forest region although some species are also found in Mexico, Greater and Lesser Antilles and other countries in South America, being an exclusively neotropical genus. The trees are usually found by river and lake edges because their seeds are carried there by floods.\n\nAll Inga species produce their seeds in \"bean-like\" pods and some can reach up to 1 m long, in general the pods are 10\u201330 cm long.\nTrees can reach up to 15 metres and they are widely used for producing shade over coffee plants. The plant benefits from well drained soil. The flowers are white with some green and the tree can produce fruits almost all year long.\nInga species, most notably Inga edulis (commonly known as \"ice-cream-bean\" or, in Spanish, guama, guaba, guaba de bejuco or paterna depending on the country or region) often have edible pulp. The name derives from the fact that those of I. edulis resembles vanilla ice cream in flavour.\nIn Ecuador, Inga edulis is known as guaba de bejuco and, the other popular species there, Inga spectabilis\n, as guaba de machete."
