  "summary": "Kirkia is a genus of plant in family Kirkiaceae. It was previously placed in family Simaroubaceae, but was transferred into Kirkiaceae, together with Pleiokirkia, because these genera produce neither quassinoids nor limonoids.\nThe genus name of Kirkia is in honour of Sir John Kirk,  (1832\u20131922), who was a physician, naturalist, companion to explorer David Livingstone, and British administrator in Zanzibar."
