## Plant Photo Funnel

Of all the photos taken (**All**)
 we filter photos that are
 within the desired geographical area (**In Geo**)

Next we filter out photos that might be 
duplicates (**Deduped**).

Finally, we only consider identifications
 where the model confidence is at least 
20% (**â‰¥ 20%**). 
We list statistics for 5% and 10% as well.
