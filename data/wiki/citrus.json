  "summary": "Citrus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs in the rue family, Rutaceae (). Plants in the genus produce citrus fruits, including crops such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits, pomelos, and limes. The genus Citrus is native to South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Melanesia, and Australia. Various citrus species have been used and domesticated by indigenous cultures in these areas since ancient times. From there its cultivation spread into Micronesia and Polynesia by the Austronesian expansion (c.\u20093000\u20131500 BCE); and to the Middle East and the Mediterranean (c.\u20091200 BCE) via the incense trade route, and onwards to Europe and the Americas."
