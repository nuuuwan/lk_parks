  "summary": "The Key lime or acid lime (Citrus \u00d7 aurantiifolia or C. aurantifolia) is a citrus hybrid (C. hystrix \u00d7 C. medica) native to tropical Southeast Asia. It has a spherical fruit, 2.5\u20135 centimetres (1\u20132 inches) in diameter. The Key lime is usually picked while it is still green, but it becomes yellow when ripe.\nThe Key lime has thinner rind and is smaller, seedier, more acidic and more aromatic than the Persian lime (Citrus \u00d7 latifolia). It is valued for its characteristic flavor. The name comes from its association with the Florida Keys, where it is best known as the flavoring ingredient in Key lime pie. It is also known as West Indian lime, bartender's lime, Omani lime, or Mexican lime, the last classified as a distinct race with a thicker skin and darker green colour. Philippine varieties have various names, including dayap and bilolo."
