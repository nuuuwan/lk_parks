  "summary": "Diospyros is a genus of over 700 species of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs. The majority are native to the tropics, with only a few species extending into temperate regions. Individual species valued for their hard, heavy, dark timber, are commonly known as ebony trees, while others are valued for their fruit and known as persimmon trees.  Some are useful as ornamentals and many are of local ecological importance. Species of this genus are generally dioecious, with separate male and female plants."
