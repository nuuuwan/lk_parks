  "summary": "Spondias is a genus of flowering plants in the cashew family, Anacardiaceae. The genus consists of 17 described species, 7 of which are native to the Neotropics and about 10 are native to tropical Asia. They are commonly named hog plums, Spanish plums, libas in Bikol and in some cases golden apples for their brightly colored fruit which resemble an apple or small plum at a casual glance. They are only distantly related to apple and plum trees, however. A more unequivocal common name is mombins.\n\nA theory regarding the name of the city of Bangkok, Thailand is that the name is derived from Thai: -\u0e21\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33; RTGS: makok nam 'water olive', the Thai name for the fruit of Spondias dulcis. In Cambodia, Spondias pinnata is called /p\u0277\u02d0n si\u02d0 p\u02b0la\u025b/ (\u1796\u17c4\u1793\u179f\u17ca\u17b8\u1795\u17d2\u179b\u17c2) or /m\u0259ka\u0294 pr\u1eb9j/ (\u1798\u17d2\u1780\u17b6\u1780\u17cb\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c3), and Spondias dulcis simply /m\u0259ka\u0294/ (\u1798\u17d2\u1780\u17b6\u1780\u17cb). Spondias pinnata is called Pulicha kaai in the Tamil language, which means \"sour fruit.\" It is also called \"Amate Kaai\" in the Kannada language, Ambade in Tulu and Konkani. In Sri Lanka it is called Amberella. In Bangladesh it is known as Aamra (\u0986\u09ae\u09a1\u09bc\u09be) and when served with seasonings it is a very popular street food."
