It is widespread across much of Asia, Africa, and various oceanic islands, with a few species in South America and on the Iberian Peninsula.The genus is named after John Fluegge, a German cryptogamic botanist.\nMembers of this genus all have entire ovate leaves and minute green flowers that form at the leaf axils in the form of fascicles or cymes. The fruits are berries, of the size of peas. With the exception of F. verrucosa, F. spirei, and occasionally F. virosa, they are dioecious."
