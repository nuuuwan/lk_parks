  "wiki_page_name": "Thunbergia",
  "summary": "Thunbergia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It includes 150 species native to tropical and subtropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, southern Asia, New Guinea, and Australia. Thunbergia species are vigorous annual or perennial vines and shrubs growing to 2\u20138 m tall. The generic name honours the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg (1743-1828).\nIts members are known by various names, including thunbergias and clockvine. Thunbergia on its own usually refers to Thunbergia grandiflora, while Thunbergia alata is often known as black-eyed Susan vine or just black-eyed Susan (not to be confused with other flowers called black-eyed Susan). Orange clockvine is the name of Thunbergia gregorii.\nThunbergias are frequent garden escapes, becoming invasive species; T. grandiflora, T. fragrans, and T. laurifolia are considered weeds in Australia."
