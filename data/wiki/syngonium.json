  "summary": "Syngonium  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to tropical rainforests in southern Mexico, the West Indies, Central and South America. They are woody vines growing to heights of 10\u201320 m or more in trees. They have leaves that change shape according to the plant's stage of growth, and adult leaf forms are often much more lobed than the juvenile forms usually seen on small house plants. The scientific name of the genus comes from the Greek words \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd ( syn - plus, z) and \u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03ae ( gone - gonada) and refers to the fused ovaries of female flowers."
